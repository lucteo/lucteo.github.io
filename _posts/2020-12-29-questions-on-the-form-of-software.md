The _No Silver Bullet_ article by Frederick P. Brooks (appeared in [The Mythical Man-Month, Anniversary Edition][1] is arguably one of the most influential articles in software engineering. Besides setting the limits of the field, it makes an essentialist claim on software engineering: there is an essence of software.

With a philosophical flavor, the present article tries to explore this direction. It tries to ask several questions related to the essence of software. Having the answers to these will probably bring significant advancements in software engineering.
