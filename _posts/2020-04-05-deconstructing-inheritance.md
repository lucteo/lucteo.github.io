description: "What is the gap between the meanings that most Object-Oriented programmers will infuse inheritance with, and what inheritance actually stands for? Are there hidden oppositions in its structure, are signifiers arbitrary? Does inheritance have inner inadequacies?"

Another article I wrote appears in Overload: Deconstructing Inheritance.

The article tries to perform a critique of Inheritance as it is present in mainstream OOP. We look from multiple points of views on the Inheritance relationship, and we show that, at a closer inspection, it doesn't reach up to the promises it makes. The article touches the simple problem of the *Rectangle* and *Square*, it discusses the parallel with the *is-a* relationship, and it shows how the Liskov Substitution Principle runs against inheritance.
