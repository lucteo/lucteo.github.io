description: "OOP cannot be essential to Software Engineering. Yes, it might help, but that doesn't make it essential. Instead, decomposition is essential; and there are more decomposition methods than the one advertised by OOP."

A new article of mine appeared in Overload: OOP Is not Essential.

Starting from a tweet from Grady Booch, the article claims that OOP is not essential in building (complex) software systems. It covers multiple meanings of the word "essential", and it also covers the features of OOP and shows that there is nothing essential in there. The true weapon of fighting complexity is decomposition, but OOP isn't the only alternative there.
