In my last Overload article, I was arguing that the senders/receivers models may be a bit too complex. Soon after writing it, I realized that this is just perceived complexity. One can change the perspective at looking at the same proposal, and with that change of perspective, the concepts may be simpler to understand and work with. Moreover, the model seems to be strong enough to use it as a base for all our concurrent applications.
